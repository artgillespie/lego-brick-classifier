Working with the family to build a "LEGO detector" that runs on a Raspberry Pi. Inspired by [Sorting Two Tons of Lego](https://jacquesmattheij.com/sorting-lego-the-software-side)

# Install

You'll need to have [Anaconda Instaled](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/macos.html)

Then, you'll want to configure a new conda environment using this repo's `environment.yml` file.

> From [Creating an environment from an environment.yml file](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file):

`$ conda env create -f environment.yml`
